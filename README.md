# traveller
toy simulating stochastic optimization algorithms (PSO, DE)

## install

download master-branch as zip file or clone it...
download c3dl and extract it to 'canvas3dapi' ('canvas3dapi/scene.js'...)

or just run
```
  rake install
```

## execution

open the 'executable/traveller.html' file. The chrome browser updates the c3dl-scene pretty fast!
