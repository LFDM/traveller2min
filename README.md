# traveller
toy simulating photons path due scattering and absorption.

## execution
- view 'executable/traveller.html' using firefox,chrome...
- javascript is executed slow enough to watch the process
- browser will become less and less responsive! 

## parameters
- g
- mu_a
- mu_s

## models
- absorption due beer-lamberts-law
- heney-greenstein scattering phase function
- azimuth angle uniformly distributed
- roulette termination

## visuals
- rendering lines for current step
- rendering direct line from start to end point for each photon
